## **Rewards Program Builder Web App Specification Document (No User Profiles)**

---

### **1. Project Overview**

The goal of the Rewards Program Builder web app is to help users create customized rewards programs by guiding them through a decision tree. The app will provide users with a final report containing the structure, rewards, and requirements of their program, as well as costs and time estimates. This is a public-facing tool where anyone can interact with the app without needing to log in or create user profiles.

The app will have two potential frontends:

1. **Dynamic Flowchart Interface**: A visual decision tree where users select options, and the app dynamically updates based on their choices.
2. **AI-Assisted Chatbot Interface**: A conversational interface where an AI guides users through the same decision process.

---

### **2. Core Features**

1. **Decision-Tree Flow**

   - The user is guided through a series of questions that dynamically adjust based on their previous answers.
   - Each selection narrows down the available options and defines rules for the next set of choices.

2. **Rules and Logic for Each Decision**

   - Logic will filter or change future questions based on the user's input.
   - Some options will be conditional (e.g., the type of rewards available based on persona selection).

3. **Final Report Generation**

   - The app will compile a report at the end summarizing:
     - The chosen persona.
     - Qualification criteria.
     - Behavior being incentivized.
     - Reward types and how they are earned.
     - Timing and beneficiaries.
     - Costs and time estimates.

4. **No User Profiles or Login**

   - There is no need for user profiles, accounts, or logins.
   - Users can access the tool anonymously and freely.

5. **Two Frontend Interfaces**:
   - **Dynamic Flowchart**: Displays the decision tree visually with interactive nodes.
   - **Chatbot Interface**: AI-driven conversation that mimics the decision tree, using natural language processing (NLP) to guide users through the same process.

---

### **4. Logic Rules for Each Decision**

- **Persona Selection**: Determines the available options for subsequent questions. For example, if the persona is “Influencer,” the qualification options might only include “Invitation Only” and “Registration.”
- **Qualifications**: May limit or filter subsequent steps. For instance, a "Free" program might restrict the types of rewards or behaviors incentivized.

- **Reward Program Type**: Certain reward programs might only allow specific behaviors to be incentivized (e.g., a “Giveaway” program incentivizes “Social Media Engagement” but not “Buying”).

- **Behavior Incentivized**: This should influence both the reward type and how the reward is earned (e.g., social media engagement might be rewarded with exclusive offers rather than cash).

- **Reward Calculation and Timing**: Dependent on the reward type (e.g., cashback program uses percentage-based rewards, loyalty program uses points).

---

### **5. Frontend Requirements**

#### **5.1 Dynamic Flowchart Interface**

- A visual decision tree with interactive nodes.
- The tree dynamically expands with each user selection.
- Tooltips or expandable sections for additional information (rules, KPIs, best practices).
- Sidebar to track progress and show current selections.

#### **5.2 AI-Assisted Chatbot Interface**

- Conversational flow based on the same decision tree logic.
- Questions are presented one at a time in a chatbot interface.
- The AI can provide recommendations or contextual tips based on user input.

---

### **6. Backend Requirements**

#### **6.1 API Logic**

- RESTful APIs to handle communication between frontend and backend.
- Endpoint to retrieve the next set of questions based on the user's last answer.
- Endpoint to generate the final report once all decisions have been made.

#### **6.2 Data Storage**

- No long-term data storage for user profiles or decisions, but temporary session data should be stored for the duration of the interaction.

#### **6.3 Report Generation**

- Once the user completes the decision tree, the backend generates a final report summarizing their choices, including estimated costs and time to implement the program.

---

### **7. Dependencies**

- **Frontend Framework**: React.js for both the dynamic flowchart interface and chatbot UI.
- **Flowchart Library**: Use a library like `react-flow` or `jointJS` for the dynamic decision tree.
- **Backend**: Node.js (or Python with Django/Flask) to handle the decision-making logic and API calls.
- **NLP API**: Use OpenAI GPT-4 (or similar) for the AI-driven chatbot.
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3 (or similar) to store final reports temporarily.

---

### **8. User Flow Summary**

1. User selects a target persona (e.g., Old Customer).
2. User decides how the target qualifies for the program (e.g., Registration).
3. User chooses a reward program type (e.g., Cashback).
4. User defines the behavior they want to incentivize (e.g., Repeat Purchasing).
5. User selects the reward type (e.g., Credits/Points).
6. User specifies how the reward is earned (e.g., Based on Purchases).
7. User determines how much the user earns (e.g., 5% Cashback).
8. User selects when the user receives the reward (e.g., Subsequent Purchases).
9. User chooses the beneficiary (e.g., Consumer).
10. The app generates a summary and report with all the details.
